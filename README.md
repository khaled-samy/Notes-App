## Problem <span id="problem"></span> :interrobang:

- Many people need to capture intuitive information about programming languages that they forget, but it is difficult to search for it on sites because of the large amount of information in the most important sites that are not useful at the present time, which wastes a lot of time searching.

---

## Solution <span id="solution"></span> :100:

- So we decided to create a website that provides the ability to users to find this is the information you want, quickly, for some popular programming languages.
- We try to build a small community that we all share common interest in tech.
